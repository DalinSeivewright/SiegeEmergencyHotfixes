# Siege Emergency Hotfixes

## Purpose
Siege Collection which is the compilation of all sub-mods for Siege++ can only be published by one developer.  Meaning if game breaking bugs are found and this one developer is not able to push up new changes to the workshop, we need some other way to Hotfix the gamemode while we wait for the real bug fix.  This repo maintains this update channel and fixes here will attempt to mitigate or undo game-breaking fixes when we cannot update the Mod proper.

When source/lua/entry does not exist, there are currently no time sensitive bugs.
